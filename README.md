# ECC-Framework
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Framework

Algorithms and protocols implemented in the project:
1- ECC (Elliptic Curve Math, ECC, Domain Parameters, Standard Curves, Key Pair Generation)
2- ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman [ephemeral], Shared Secret Generation)
3- ECDSA
4- EC ElGamal (EC ElGamal Encryption and EC ElGamal Signature)
5- ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme, Key Derivation Functions [KDF] based on Argon2id, MAC, Twofish Symmetric Encryption)
6- HMAC (BLAKE2b, SHA2 Family, SHA-3 Family)

If you find any bugs or improvements, please let me know.
