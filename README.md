# ECC Framework
# Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Framework

Algorithms and Protocols Implemented in the Project:

1- ECC (Elliptic Curve Math, ECC, Domain Parameters, Standard Curves, Key Pair Generation)

2- ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman [ephemeral], Shared Secret Generation)

3- ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm with Arbitrary Hash Function. e.g. BLAKE2b)

4- EC ElGamal (EC ElGamal Encryption and EC ElGamal Signature)

5- ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme, Key Derivation Functions [KDF] based on Argon2id, MAC, Twofish Symmetric Encryption)

6- HMAC (BLAKE2b, SHA2 Family, SHA-3 Family)

-------------------------------

Libraries and Codes Used in the Project:

1- GMP

2- Givaro

3- OpenSSL (Only Hash Functions such as SHA)

4- Argon2

5- BLAKE2

6- Twofish Encryption (Neil Fergusonâ€™s Twofish C library)
